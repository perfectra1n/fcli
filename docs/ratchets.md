# Ratchets

A **ratchet** is a gate that measures one number about the codebase, fails when it
grows, and nags when it shrinks. Every ratchet in this repo is a `mise` task; run
them all with `mise run ratchets`, or one at a time by name. CI runs the same
tasks, so there is exactly one definition of each gate.

```
mise run panic-check       # panicking constructs in shipping code
mise run exit-check        # std::process::exit outside main.rs
mise run support-check     # non-admin modules reaching into cmd/admin/support
mise run zero-check        # zero values written into omittable request-body fields
mise run complexity-check  # functions over the cognitive-complexity threshold
mise run budget-check      # startup latency and release binary size
mise run coverage-check    # commands never driven against a real Forgejo (needs Docker)
```

`coverage-check` is the one ratchet that is not a text scan, and deliberately so —
see [the design note](superpowers/specs/2026-09-16-command-coverage-design.md). The
integration suite *skips and passes* when Docker is missing, so a scan of the test
sources would report full coverage over a suite that executed nothing. It therefore
counts journals the tests write **as they run**, and it is excluded from
`mise run ratchets` (which must stay fast and Docker-free) and runs in CI's
integration job instead.

## Why a count budget, and not a threshold

The obvious way to add a lint to a codebase that already violates it is to set the
threshold at the worst offender and turn it on. That is worse than doing nothing.

Say the most complex function in the tree scores 47. Set
`cognitive-complexity-threshold = 47` and the gate is green — and it now *permits*
every new function up to 47. The rule has been inverted: a number that was meant to
describe the debt has become a licence to write more of it, and the licence is
generous precisely in proportion to how bad the worst existing code is.

A count budget inverts that back. The threshold stays where it should be (25, the
aspirational number), and what is frozen is the *count* of things above it:

> It is a count budget with an aspirational per-function threshold — not a
> permissive threshold sized to the worst offender — so a NEW overly-complex
> function fails immediately even while the legacy offenders are still being paid
> down.

The legacy offenders are visible, countable, and unblocking. A new offender fails
on the commit that introduces it, which is the only moment at which fixing it is
cheap.

## The two halves, and why the second one matters more

Every ratchet task here does two things, and skipping either one breaks it:

1. **Over budget fails, and the message says how to fix the code — never how to
   raise the budget.** A gate whose failure message explains how to silence it is
   a gate that will be silenced. Read any of the `error:` blocks in
   `.mise/config.toml`: they name the construct to use instead (`return an
   ErrorKind`, `move the shared plumbing up a level`, `restore the lazy path`).

2. **Under budget prints a note telling you to ratchet the budget down to the new
   count.** This is the half that stops a ratchet from rotting. Without it a
   budget only ever describes the codebase on the day it was written: somebody
   removes four unwraps, nobody lowers the number, and four new unwraps can now be
   added for free. The gate is still green, still running, and no longer gating
   anything. The note is how the budget follows the code down.

So the drain loop is: fix something, run the check, read the note, lower the
`BUDGET=` line in `.mise/config.toml` in the same commit. Every check takes a
`--list` (or has a companion `mise run complexity`) that prints the actual
offenders, which is where you start.

## No allowlist

None of these six ratchets has an exemption file, deliberately. An allowlist earns
its place when an item can be *legitimately* non-compliant and a reviewer has to
decide case by case — kopiur's inert-field ratchet is the example: a CRD field can
be genuinely unread for a good reason, so each exemption carries a written
justification.

A count budget does not have that shape. Nothing here is a permanent, defensible
exception; every one of these numbers should reach zero (or, for the binary, reach
the target). A list would just be a slower way of writing the same integer, with
more surface to rot. If one is ever added, it must follow kopiur's rule that makes
an allowlist self-draining: **an entry that becomes compliant must fail the
check**, so the list cannot outlive the work.

## The six ratchets

### `panic-check` — panicking constructs in shipping code

Counts `unwrap()`, `expect(`, `panic!`, `todo!` and `unimplemented!` outside
`generated/`, outside `tests/`, outside `#[cfg(test)]`, and outside the
`fjo-itest` crate — which is `publish = false` and is, by its own doc comment,
"Harness for tests that run against a real Forgejo". An unwrap there fails a test
loudly, which is the behaviour you want. That carve-out is named explicitly in
`.mise/scan.py` (`TEST_CRATES`) rather than being a silent skip, and only this
check honours it.

`forgejo-core`'s `FakeTransport` is *not* carved out, even though it is also a
test double: it lives in a published crate and is compiled into shipping builds,
so its seven `expect(`s really are in the artifact. Feature-gating it is a real
drain for this ratchet.

`fjo`'s entire value proposition is its error taxonomy: one renderer, a three-part
shape (what failed / why / what to do), and a test asserting that **every**
`ErrorKind` variant's rendering contains a "what to do" section with a literal
runnable command. A panic bypasses all of it and hands the user a Rust backtrace —
the one output shape the taxonomy promises never to emit. Every panic is a hole
punched straight through the feature the tool is for.

This is not a hypothetical. Commit `0c2fcc7` shipped three clap panics, because
clap answers a duplicate long name with a panic rather than an error: a one-word
typo in layer 2's command table turns into a backtrace on *every* invocation of
the binary, including `--help`.

To drain: `python3 .mise/scan.py panic --list`, then return an `ErrorKind`. If the
invariant really is unreachable, make it unrepresentable rather than asserting it
at runtime.

### `exit-check` — `std::process::exit` outside `main.rs`

Counts calls anywhere but `crates/fjo/src/main.rs`. **Currently at zero**, so
this is a "stays drained" gate.

`main.rs` owns the process exit code because the `ErrorKind` exit-code table is a
public contract that scripts are invited to depend on: `0`/`1`/`2`/`4` matching
`gh`, plus `5` not-found, `6` network, `7` server, `8` rate-limited, `130` SIGINT.
A `process::exit` somewhere else hard-codes a number *beside* that table, so the
code a calling script observes stops being the one the taxonomy documents. It also
never unwinds, so it skips the pager flush and the grouped unknown-field note on
the way out.

It reached zero the hard way. `crates/fjo/src/cmd/pr/checks.rs`
(`Verdict::Failed`) was the last such call — its own doc comment flagged it as the
one thing not yet on the taxonomy — and it is now an `ErrorKind`, so the exit code
for a failed check run is decided in the same table as every other exit code.

### `support-check` — non-admin modules reaching into `cmd/admin/support`

Counts files outside `crates/fjo/src/cmd/admin/` that import
`crate::cmd::admin::support`. **Currently at zero**, so this is a "stays drained"
gate.

`support` is general-purpose output plumbing (`Emit`/`Json` and the test helpers)
that happens to live inside the admin command group. Every module that reaches into
it writes an edge into the dependency graph asserting that *topics depend on
administration*, that *webhooks depend on administration*, that *reactions depend
on administration* — none of which is true, and all of which a reader of the module
tree has to un-learn.

The cause was mechanical rather than a design choice: `cmd/mod.rs` was frozen while
six agents worked in parallel, so nobody could add a shared module without
colliding, and the nearest already-existing home won. Eleven modules ended up
reaching in — `topic`, `block`, `transfer`, `webhook`, `deploy_key`, `reaction`
among them.

The plumbing now lives at `crates/fjo/src/cmd/support/` where it belongs, and the
count is zero. The gate stays because the cause will recur: the next time a shared
file is contended, the nearest already-existing home will look attractive again,
and this is what says no.

### `zero-check` — zero values written into omittable request-body fields

Counts places where a request-body field whose `Option` exists to be *omitted*
is handed a value that means "the user said nothing". **Currently at zero**, so
this is a "stays drained" gate.

A generated request-body model spells a not-required field `Option<T>` with
`skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none"`, so a field nobody set is left out of
the JSON. That is not a style choice — it is the fix for a data-loss defect
(`b62c3d1`), where the uniform `DefaultPlain` presence policy meant every PATCH
was a full overwrite that blanked whatever the user had not mentioned. A call
site that writes `Some(x.unwrap_or_default())` hands the model the exact zero
value the `Option` existed to omit, and the overwrite comes straight back.

The live symptom was `fjo repo fork` answering `500 name is empty`, because the
call site turned "no `--fork-name`" into `Some("")`. It was 14 files and roughly
40 call sites.

**No test caught it, and no test could have.** `FakeTransport` accepts any body,
so the only assertion that can fail is one on the *shape* of the request —
`sent.get("name").is_none()` — and almost none exist. `repo fork` now has one
(`an_unset_flag_is_omitted_from_the_body_rather_than_sent_as_an_empty_string`),
but writing 485 of them is not a plan. This is a class the suite is
structurally blind to, which is the case a ratchet is for.

#### Why a type-scoped scan, and not a grep, a clippy lint, or an allowlist

This was the design decision, so it is written down rather than implied.

**Not a grep.** `Some(...unwrap_or_default())` as a text pattern is worse than
no gate. This tree contains `GlobalOpts { json: Some(String::new()) }`,
`PageInfo`, `ResolveOptions`, `Some(Vec::new())` fixtures, and query clamps like
`Some(i32::try_from(limit).unwrap_or(i32::MAX))` — none of them the bug. A gate
that cries wolf is a gate the first person it inconveniences deletes, and then
the real defect ships behind a disabled check.

**Not a clippy lint.** There is no such lint, and a custom one means `dylint`, a
nightly driver and an install step, against a repo pinned to stable 1.98.1 whose
scanner documents "a lint gate that needs its own install step is a lint gate
people delete". The property being checked is a *serde attribute* on the field,
which a lint would have to read off the HIR anyway — far more machinery than the
question needs.

**Not an allowlist.** One was nearly required, and the thing that removed the
need is worth recording. The bug has two shapes, and only one of them is ever
ambiguous:

* a **fallback** — an absence collapsed into a zero (`unwrap_or_default()`,
  `unwrap_or("")`, `unwrap_or_else(String::new)`, an `if`/`match` with a zero
  arm). This is the bug for a field of any type, with no legitimate use.
* an **unconditional zero constant** — `Some(String::new())`, `Some(Vec::new())`,
  `Some(0)`. Whether this is a defect depends on the field: an explicit empty
  *list* on a create is ordinary API usage (`admin/quota.rs` deliberately sends
  `rules: Some(Vec::new())`, and says in a note that the group "limits nothing
  until a rule is attached"), and so is an explicit `Some(0)` limit — its comment
  explains that a named rule is created with a zero limit on purpose. An explicit
  empty *string*, though, is precisely the overwrite-with-blank that caused the
  data loss.

So the check reads the field's inner type out of the model and lets that decide:
a fallback counts for every field, an unconditional constant counts only for a
`String` or a nested model. That is a rule, not an exemption, and it takes the
count to zero with nothing to justify case by case. Had it not, the allowlist
would have had to follow kopiur's self-draining rule — an entry that becomes
compliant must FAIL the check — which is the only version that cannot rot.

#### What the scan actually looks at

The set of fields that can be wrong is **derived, not listed**: any struct in
the workspace with `skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none"` on an `Option<T>`,
because that attribute *is* the contract being protected. 127 types qualify.
Three consequences:

* Query structs carry no such attribute, so the entire `unwrap_or(i32::MAX)`
  clamp family drops out before a single expression is examined.
* The **hand-written** patch bodies qualify too — `IssuePatch`, `LabelPatch`,
  `MilestonePatch`, `ReleasePatch` in `cmd/issue/shared.rs` are sparse PATCH
  bodies with the identical contract, and they are where an overwrite would hurt
  most. Scoping to `forgejo-model/src/generated/` would have missed them.
* When the spec moves, the set follows codegen instead of rotting in a literal.

Only a value in **result position** counts, so
`Some(xs.map(|x| x.unwrap_or_default()).collect())` is not a hit: the zero is
per-element, not the field. Both construction idioms are covered — the struct
literal, and `patch.title = Some(...)` on a local whose type *resolves* to a body
model, which is how the sparse patches are really built. The receiver's type is
resolved rather than guessed, because matching on field name alone would flag
`out.title`, `ctx.path` and `self.branch`.

Left alone, correctly: `unwrap_or_else(|| current.x.clone())` read-modify-write
fallbacks in `org.rs`/`team.rs`/`webhook.rs`; `release.rs`'s name falling back to
the tag; the generated wiki commit message; and a bare `Default::default()` on
an `Option` field, which is `None` and therefore already right.

#### The self-test is part of the gate

`zero-check` runs `python3 .mise/scan.py selftest` before it counts anything,
and fails if it fails. This is the only check here whose correctness is not
obvious from reading it — the other three are a regex over scrubbed text, this
one classifies Rust expressions — and a classifier nobody has seen fail is not
known to work. The fixtures pin 28 expressions (every spelling the real bug was
found in, and every look-alike in this tree that must not count), the
assignment form with its two negatives, and two scrubbing proofs: a file whose
only mention of the pattern is a `///` example, a `//` explanation and a
`#[cfg(test)]` fixture must count **zero**, and *the same file with a real defect
planted in it* must count one. Without the second half the first is just proof
of a dead scan.

That pairing is not theoretical either. Three times in one session a text search
in this repo matched prose *about* a defect and reported it as the defect: a doc
comment mentioning `cmd::admin::support`, a comment containing `#[ignore]`, and a
server message that existed only inside a comment.

To drain — if it ever leaves zero — `python3 .mise/scan.py zero --list`, then
pass the `Option` straight through (`name: args.fork_name.clone()`), so an unset
flag stays unset. If the field genuinely needs a value when the user gave none,
compute a *meaningful* one — read the current value back and send that, the way
`org edit` does.

### `complexity-check` — functions over the cognitive-complexity threshold

Counts distinct functions clippy reports above
`cognitive-complexity-threshold = 25` (pinned in `clippy.toml`).

The threshold is pinned rather than left implicit so the ratchet is stable across
toolchain bumps: if clippy retunes its default, an unpinned threshold silently
moves the baseline and the gate either goes red for nobody's change or quietly
stops gating. The lint is allow-by-default, so the ordinary `mise run clippy` gate
is unaffected either way.

`mise run complexity` prints the offenders with file and line; the repo idiom for
fixing one is extracting pure, unit-testable helpers rather than reaching for
`#[allow]`.

### `budget-check` — startup latency and binary size

Three numbers, all measuring the same design decision.

Layer 2 binds ~506 operations through clap's **builder** API over a `const` table,
constructing each subtree lazily, precisely because clap's derive path would build
all ~3,000 args on every invocation — including `fjo --version`, which needs none
of them. That decision is invisible in the source: nothing stops someone
reintroducing an eager build, and nothing would fail except the clock.

* `fjo --version` — the no-subtree case.
* `fjo raw repo create-pull-request --help` — the one-subtree case. Comparing the
  two separates "startup got slower" from "subtree construction got slower".
* stripped release binary size — the third face of the same decision: ~61k
  generated lines with zero type generics and no macros-with-logic, so nothing
  monomorphises per call site.

The two latency budgets are the plan's stated contract (25 ms and 40 ms), not
numbers fitted to a developer laptop, where they measure ~1.0 ms and ~0.6 ms. The
headroom is roughly 20x, so the ratchet-down note fires on every green run: it is
asking for a tightening that needs CI variance data to pick safely, because a
budget fitted to a fast idle machine is how a gate goes red for the first person
whose runner is busy.

Binary size was the opposite case and was real debt. The 15 MB figure had **never
been met**: the stripped binary measured 18.35 MB, and the CI budgets job that
asserted 15 MB was therefore red on `main` before anybody noticed. `SIZE_BUDGET`
was set at 18 MiB, just above where the code actually was, with 15 MB named as the
aspiration — because a gate that is red on arrival gets disabled by the first
person it inconveniences.

It has since been drained, and how is worth recording, because the answer was not
where the budget's own error message points. **The generated code was never the
problem.** Attributing `.text` by symbol on an unstripped build:

| | `.text` |
| --- | --- |
| `forgejo_client` — 53k generated lines, 506 operations | 89,856 |
| `forgejo_model` — 8k generated lines, 233 structs | 153,332 |
| `fjo::cmd::*` — hand-written porcelain bodies | 1,130,648 |
| clap **derive** glue for that porcelain (`augment_subcommands` et al) | 1,054,228 |

Layer 2 binds 506 operations for under 90 KB. Layer 3 binds 238 through clap's
derive macro and spends more than a megabyte on the generated `augment_*`
functions alone — a single one, `<fjo::cmd::Porcelain as Subcommand>::augment_subcommands`,
is 135,644 bytes. The "zero generics, zero macros-with-logic" rule held exactly
where it was written down: the 17 `impl<...>` blocks in the generated client are
lifetime-only and do not monomorphise, and there are no `macro_rules!` under
either generated root. The rule simply was never applied to the hand-written half.

What actually drained it was the release profile, measured lever by lever rather
than assumed. From 19,068,392 bytes:

| lever | delta |
| --- | --- |
| `lto = "fat"` (was `"thin"`) | −1,225,488 |
| `opt-level = "s"` (was the default 3) | −5,643,648 |
| `codegen-units = 1` (already set; vs the default 16) | −1,344,272 |
| `panic = "abort"` (already set; vs `"unwind"`) | −2,127,744 |

That lands at **12,199,256 bytes**, so the 15 MB aspiration is met with ~2.8 MB of
headroom and `SIZE_BUDGET` follows the binary down. `opt-level = "z"` was measured
too — 10,774,104 bytes, another 1.4 MB — and rejected: it costs ~29% on the
heaviest CPU-bound path against ~8% for `"s"`, and the budget was already met.

Both startup budgets were re-measured after every one of those changes, because an
opt-level that trades startup for size would quietly undo the lazy-subtree design
this gate exists to protect. Neither regressed: `--version` went 1.09 → 1.21 ms
against 25 ms, and `raw ... --help` 0.56 → 0.58 ms against 40 ms.

The lesson for the next person draining this one: the gate's error message says to
check what the change "pulled into `forgejo-client`", and that advice was pointed
at the wrong half of the codebase. If the binary grows again, attribute `.text` by
symbol before believing any story about the cause.

## Implementation notes

`.mise/scan.py` is the scanner behind `panic-check`, `exit-check`,
`support-check` and `zero-check`. It is the `fjo` analogue of kopiur's `crates/xtask/src/scan.rs`
and makes the same trade deliberately: it reads `.rs` files as **text** and never
parses Rust. A parser is a dependency, a build-time cost, and a new way for a gate
to fail on valid source. Text scanning can only be conservative, which is the
property a ratchet needs — over-removal makes a count too low, never too high, so
the gate can nag but cannot cry wolf.

It does three passes, matching `scan.rs`:

* **scrub** — strip comments and string/char literals, so a name appearing only in
  a doc comment or an error message is not mistaken for code. (`checks.rs` mentions
  `std::process::exit` twice in prose for every one time it calls it.)
* **strip `#[cfg(test)]`** — by brace matching, so fixtures do not count. It also
  resolves `#[cfg(test)] mod tests;` to the *file* it names: without that,
  `forgejo-core/src/context/git/tests.rs` contributes 54 perfectly good test
  unwraps to the panic count.
* **walk** — `.rs` under `crates/`, skipping `generated/` (machine-written; the
  `codegen-check` drift guard owns that tree) and `tests/`.

`zero-check` adds one bit to the first pass. `scrub(keep_quotes=True)` blanks a
string literal's *interior* but leaves its delimiters standing, so `"main"`
becomes `"    "` while `""` stays `""` — the check has to tell `unwrap_or("")`
from `unwrap_or("main")`, and this exposes exactly that one bit and nothing
else. Prose inside a literal still cannot match anything, offsets and line
numbers are unchanged, and the three older checks do not ask for it. It also
runs its own walk for the field derivation, because that one must include
`generated/` — the models are most of what defines the contract.

Where the scan is uncertain it undercounts rather than overcounts, which is the
direction a ratchet is allowed to be wrong in. `_split_top` does not track angle
brackets (`<` is also a comparison operator, and guessing there would invent
syntax), so an initialiser containing a generic with a comma in it splits into
fragments that simply fail to match. A missed hit is a gate that has not yet
fired; an invented one is a gate that gets deleted.

Its only dependency is a stock `python3`. Keep it that way: a lint gate that needs
its own install step is a lint gate people delete.
