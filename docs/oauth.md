# OAuth login

`fjo auth login --web` obtains a credential through the browser instead of asking the user to
paste a personal access token. It is opt-in: bare `fjo auth login` still prompts for a token, and
`FJO_TOKEN` / `FORGEJO_TOKEN` are unchanged.

```
fjo auth login --host codeberg.org --web
fjo auth login --host git.example.org --web --no-browser   # over SSH
```

## Why it exists

A token login sends the user to a settings page to tick scopes, copy a secret, and paste it into
a terminal. The secret then never expires, so a leaked one is leaked forever. An OAuth session
expires in an hour, renews itself, and never crosses the clipboard.

It also works on instances behind an external identity provider without fjo knowing anything
about it. The browser round trip goes to Forgejo, which delegates to Authentik or Keycloak or
whatever else and delegates back. A token minted by that provider directly would **not** work —
Forgejo's API only accepts credentials Forgejo itself issued.

## What Forgejo implements

Every item here was established by reading Forgejo's source or measuring a running instance, and
several are not what someone who knows OAuth would assume.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Grants | `authorization_code` and `refresh_token` only |
| Device flow | **None.** forgejo/forgejo#4830 is open; the implementation is still a draft |
| PKCE | `S256`, and **mandatory** for public clients |
| Authorize | `/login/oauth/authorize` |
| Token | `/login/oauth/access_token` — note, not `/token` |
| Discovery | `/.well-known/openid-configuration` |
| Access token | one hour by default (`ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRATION_TIME`) |
| Refresh token | 730 hours, about a month (`REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRATION_TIME`), and **rotated on every refresh** |
| Scopes | not implemented; an OAuth token can do anything the user can |
| `scope` parameter | optional, so fjo omits it and receives no `id_token` |
| Auth header | `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`, where a personal access token uses `Authorization: token <hex>` |

Three of these shape the implementation more than the rest.

**The redirect URI must carry no path.** Forgejo compares redirect URIs by exact string after
uppercasing and trimming one trailing slash. For a public client on `http` at a loopback IP it
first strips the *port* and compares again — but not the path. The built-in applications register
`http://127.0.0.1`, so `http://127.0.0.1:45231` matches and `http://127.0.0.1:45231/callback`
does not. Appending the `/callback` that most OAuth guides use breaks every login with a generic
`redirect_uri_mismatch` that says nothing about paths. `127.0.0.1` and not `localhost`, too: the
loopback special case parses the host as an IP address, and a name is not one.

**Refresh tokens rotate.** Every refresh mints a new one, and whether the previous one keeps
working depends on the instance's `INVALIDATE_REFRESH_TOKENS`. So fjo writes the new refresh
token *before* using the access token that came with it: if that write fails and the token is
used anyway, the session works for an hour and is then unrecoverable, because the token that
would have renewed it was never recorded.

**There is no device flow.** A machine with no browser cannot complete a self-contained login.
`--no-browser` prints the URL, the user opens it wherever they have a browser, Forgejo redirects
to `127.0.0.1` *there* and fails to connect, and the user pastes the resulting URL back. That is
the whole of the headless story until forgejo/forgejo#4830 lands.

## Which client ID

By default, Forgejo's built-in `git-credential-oauth` application, which every stock instance
registers with `http://127.0.0.1` as a redirect URI and no client secret. That means a login
against an unmodified instance needs no setup.

It is not fjo's own ID, and **the consent screen will say "git-credential-oauth"**. Borrowing it
is a deliberate trade: zero-setup login anywhere, at the cost of a consent screen naming the
wrong tool. The long-term fix is an upstream change adding `fjo` to Forgejo's
`BuiltinApplications()`.

An administrator can switch the built-in applications off through `[oauth2]
DEFAULT_APPLICATIONS`. For an instance that registers its own application instead:

```
fjo auth login --host git.example.org --web --client-id <ID>
fjo config set oauth_client_id <ID> --host git.example.org   # remembered per host
```

## How the credential is stored

As one JSON document in the usual credential store — the OS keyring, or `hosts.toml` at mode
0600 — under the same `(host, login)` key a token would use. It holds the access token, the
refresh token, the expiry, the client ID and the token endpoint.

One document rather than several fields because those values must agree and all change together
on every refresh. Split across two backends, a rotation is two writes with no transaction, and a
crash in the gap leaves a refresh token the server has already invalidated beside an access token
that still works. `hosts.toml` records only an advisory `kind = "oauth2"`, which nothing depends
on.

**An older fjo cannot read one.** It will send the document as though it were a token and get a
401 whose advice is to log in again. That is deliberate: shaping the document so an old build
half-works would trade a loud, correct error for a credential that functions for an hour and then
fails with no explanation.

## Lifetime, and what to use in CI

Sessions are renewed automatically, five minutes before the access token lapses, and lapse for
good after about thirty days. `fjo auth status` shows which kind of credential a login holds and
when it next renews.

**CI should use a token, not an OAuth session.** A token created in the web UI does not expire
and needs no browser. `fjo auth login --with-token < token.txt`, or `FJO_TOKEN` in the
environment.

## What is tested, and what is not

`crates/fjo-itest/tests/live_oauth.rs` drives the whole flow against a real Forgejo, including
the consent click. A stand-in browser signs in, posts the grant, and fetches the redirect, so
fjo's own PKCE, loopback listener, state check, token exchange and storage all run for real; the
stored session is then spent on live API calls to prove Forgejo accepts it as `Bearer`.

This needs no HTML parsing, which is why it is worth having. Forgejo 16.0.4's sign-in form
carries no CSRF token, and neither does the grant form — every field the grant form submits is a
value that was already in the authorize URL. So there is no markup dependency to rot.

The redirect-URI rule is pinned directly: with a session, an authorize request naming
`http://127.0.0.1:<port>` answers `200` and one naming `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/callback` answers
`400`. Checking it needs the session, because `reqSignIn` runs before the handler and bounces
every unauthenticated request to `/user/login` whatever it asks for — a good redirect URI and a
bad one look identical from outside.

Still not covered:

* **A real browser.** The stand-in does what a browser does over HTTP, but nothing exercises an
  actual browser launch, and `open::with_detached` is taken on trust.
* **Keyring storage.** The live tests use the file store, as the whole suite does; the keyring
  path is covered only by unit tests.
* **Logging out does not revoke the grant server-side.** `fjo auth logout` removes the local
  credential; the authorization remains listed under the account's settings until revoked there.
