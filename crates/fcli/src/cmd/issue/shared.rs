//! Porcelain plumbing shared by the `issue`, `label`, `milestone` and `release` groups.
//!
//! What is left here is the part that is **about issues, labels, milestones and releases**: the
//! sparse patch bodies, the newtyped API wrappers, and the name-to-id resolvers. The general
//! plumbing this file used to carry — the stderr note, `usage`, the editor split, the limit
//! chain, `@me` — moved to [`crate::cmd::support`] once `cmd/mod.rs` could be edited again. There
//! is one `@me` resolver, which is what stops `-a @me` from coming to mean two things.
//!
//! Three decisions here are worth reading before using any of it.
//!
//! # 1. Sparse patch bodies, not the generated `Edit*Option` models
//!
//! The Forgejo Swagger document does not record which properties are Go pointers, so the
//! generated `Edit*Option` structs have plain `String`/`bool`/`Vec` fields with no
//! `skip_serializing_if`. Every one of them therefore serialises **every** field, and Forgejo
//! reads a present-but-empty field as an instruction:
//!
//! | sent | Forgejo does |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | `"body": ""` | clears the issue body |
//! | `"state": ""` | `"" != "closed"`, so it **reopens a closed issue** |
//! | `"milestone": 0` | unsets the milestone |
//! | `"assignees": []` | unassigns everybody |
//! | `"draft": false` | **publishes a draft release** |
//!
//! So `fcli issue close 42` written the obvious way would close the issue and wipe its body,
//! and `fcli release edit v1 -n notes` would publish a draft. The bodies in this module are
//! `Option`-per-field and skip `None`, so an unmentioned field is genuinely absent from the
//! JSON.
//!
//! **The emitter has since been fixed** — a generated `Edit*Option` now skips the fields nobody
//! set, which `the_generated_edit_option_sends_nothing_it_was_not_given` below pins. These
//! structs stay because they are also how this module says "clear this field" as distinct from
//! "leave it alone", which the generated models still cannot express.
//!
//! # 2. Field discovery runs before the runtime exists
//!
//! [`Out::prepare`] is called at the top of a synchronous `run`, before `block_on`, so bare
//! `--json` needs no host, no token, and no network. That is a contract; see `docs/output.md`.
//!
//! Human output goes to stdout, notes and progress to stderr:
//!
//! `Out` owns the destination so that a command never reaches for `println!`, and so that
//! tests can capture what a command wrote without a subprocess.
//!
//! # 3. `IssueIndex` never becomes an `i64` outside this module
//!
//! The generated client takes `index: i64` and `id: i64` — it cannot tell them apart. The
//! wrappers at the bottom of this file take the newtypes, so every call site in layers above
//! is type-checked, and `.get()` appears in exactly one place per operation.
