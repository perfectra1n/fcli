//! `fcli git-hook` — the server-side git hooks Forgejo runs on push.
//!
//! Neither `gh` nor `tea` has this: GitHub has no server-side hook API at all, and `tea` never
//! wrapped Forgejo's. Layer 2 already reaches all four operations
//! (`fcli raw repo list-git-hooks` and friends), so this group exists only for the three things
//! layer 2 cannot do well — see `docs/porcelain-conventions.md`.
//!
//! # There is no `delete`, because the API's DELETE does not delete
//!
//! `DELETE /repos/{o}/{r}/hooks/git/{id}` reads as "remove the hook", and it does not. Forgejo's
//! git hooks are a **fixed set** built into the server ([`KNOWN_HOOKS`]); a repository always has
//! all of them and the API exposes no way to add or remove one. The DELETE route loads the named
//! hook, sets its content to the empty string and writes it back, which removes the hook *file*
//! from disk and leaves the hook itself listed with `is_active: false`. `list` shows it
//! afterwards, unchanged but inactive.
//!
//! So the verb here is [`Cmd::Disable`], not `delete`. Somebody who types
//! `fcli git-hook delete pre-receive` expecting the hook to stop existing has been misled by the
//! route name, and the fix is not to repeat the lie: `delete` is accepted as a **hidden**
//! subcommand whose whole job is to explain what actually happens and name `disable`. That is
//! strictly better than clap's "unrecognized subcommand", which leaves the reader believing the
//! capability is missing rather than misnamed.
//!
//! # Why a table cannot render a hook
//!
//! A hook is a shell script. [`crate::output::Table`] replaces every newline and tab in a cell
//! with a space — it has to, or a piped row would parse as several records — so rendering a
//! hook's content through it produces one long unrunnable line. `view` therefore writes the
//! script to stdout **verbatim**, so that
//!
//! ```text
//! fcli git-hook view pre-receive > pre-receive && chmod +x pre-receive
//! ```
//!
//! yields the file the server is running. `--json`/`--jq`/`--template` still go through the
//! normal pipeline, because those callers asked for a document rather than a script.
//!
//! # Hook names are suggested, never enforced
//!
//! [`KNOWN_HOOKS`] is what Forgejo ships today, and it is used for help text and for the hint in
//! an error — but any name is sent to the server as typed. This is the same rule the generated
//! open enums follow: the server is authoritative about its own vocabulary, and a client-side
//! allowlist would make a newer Forgejo's fourth hook unreachable through the porcelain while
//! `fcli raw` kept working. Guessing wrong costs one 404 that names the hook.
