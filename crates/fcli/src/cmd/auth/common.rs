//! Shared plumbing for the setup surface (`auth`, `config`, `alias`, `completion`, `status`).
//!
//! It lives under `auth` because `auth login` is the command that forces the shape: every other
//! group may assume a configured host and reach for [`crate::runtime::Runtime`], while `auth
//! login` runs *before* a host exists and therefore has to assemble `Config`, `Hosts` and
//! `Credentials` by hand. Rather than have two ways to read the configuration directory, the
//! by-hand path is written once here and the rest of the setup surface uses it too.
//!
//! The general plumbing this once carried — the stderr note, the prompting gate, the
//! confirmation, the compiled `--json`/`--jq`/`--template` triad — now lives in
//! [`crate::cmd::support`]. What is left is the part that is genuinely about authentication.
//!
//! # The token never becomes a named `String`
//!
//! `secrecy` is deliberately not a dependency of this crate, so `SecretString` cannot be *named*
//! here. That is a feature: every place a plaintext token exists is a `&str` passed straight into
//! either an `Authorization` header or [`forgejo_core::config::Credentials::store`], and there is
//! no local binding for a `grep` to find or a `Debug` to print.
