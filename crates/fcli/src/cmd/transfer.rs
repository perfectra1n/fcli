//! `fcli transfer` — moving a repository to a new owner, as an **offer**.
//!
//! `gh` has no `repo transfer` at all, and the reason it would not port cleanly is that Forgejo's
//! model is genuinely a different shape from GitHub's. On Forgejo a transfer is a *pending offer*:
//!
//! ```text
//!  the current owner            the new owner
//!  ─────────────────            ─────────────
//!  fcli transfer start them  ─▶  (repository still lives at you/repo,
//!                                 marked as pending transfer to `them`)
//!                                fcli transfer accept  -R you/repo
//!                                fcli transfer reject  -R you/repo
//! ```
//!
//! **The two commands are run by two different people, with two different tokens.** That is the
//! single most important fact about this group, so it is in the `--help` of every subcommand and
//! not only here.
//!
//! Two consequences that are easy to get wrong:
//!
//! * `accept` and `reject` address the repository by its **current** path — the *old* owner's —
//!   because the repository has not moved yet. `-R them/repo` 404s; `-R you/repo` is right.
//! * A transfer into an organization can be scoped to teams with `--team`, and only an
//!   organization-owned repository can have teams, which is why `--team` is not the default.
//!
//! `status` has no endpoint of its own: the pending offer arrives as `repo_transfer` on the
//! repository itself, which is why `status` is a `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}` and reads the
//! `doer`/`recipient` pair out of it. Reporting "no transfer pending" from a successful read is
//! deliberate — a missing `repo_transfer` is an answer, not a 404.
