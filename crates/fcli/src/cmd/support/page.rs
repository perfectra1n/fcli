/// a bare `Stream` with nowhere to hang a total. So when the list came back *full*, meaning there
/// may well be more behind it, the count is asked for directly: the operation's `_page` twin, one
/// item wide, purely for its header. `probe` is that call with the [`Paging`] supplied.
///
/// Three properties are deliberate:
///
/// - **It costs a request only when the list was truncated.** A list shorter than its cap is the
///   whole collection and already knows its own size, which is the answer returned without asking
///   anybody. `--paginate` with no `--limit` lands here too, because its cap is `usize::MAX`.
/// - **It never fails the listing.** A probe that is refused, 404s, or comes back without the
///   header yields `None`, and the banner falls back to `Showing N` — the wording it had before.
///   Turning a successful list into an error over a cosmetic header would be a poor trade.
/// - **Machine output never reaches it.** `--json`/`--jq`/`--template` return before the banner
///   is built, so no request is spent on a line nobody prints.
///
/// Note this is *not* the shape `block`/`reaction` use. Those fetch the list itself through the
/// `_page` twin, which reads `x-total-count` for free but takes `limit` as a page size — and
/// Forgejo silently clamps that to `max_response_items`, so `-L 100` on a 50-item instance
/// quietly returns 50. The lists here follow the `Link` header through `ItemStream` precisely to
/// avoid that, and keeping the total on a separate probe is what lets them keep doing so.
