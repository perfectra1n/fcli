//! When a command may ask a question, and what to do with the answer.
//!
//! # The gate
//!
//! **stdin *and* stdout must both be real terminals**, and prompting must not have been switched
//! off. `docs/porcelain-conventions.md` makes that binding, and both halves matter:
//!
//! - stdin alone is not enough. With stdout redirected the question itself is captured into the
//!   file and the user stares at a command that looks hung with no visible prompt.
//! - stdout alone is not enough. `fcli repo delete x < /dev/null` in a CI job that allocates a
//!   TTY has a terminal on stdout and nothing on stdin: the prompt blocks until the job times
//!   out. This is the failure the rule exists to prevent, and the reason the check here uses
//!   the *real* `stdout().is_terminal()` and not [`crate::output::Term::tty`] — `FCLI_FORCE_TTY`
//!   asks for padded columns in a pipe, which is a rendering request and not a claim that a
//!   human is watching.
//!
//! # Cancellation is not failure
//!
//! Ctrl-C or Ctrl-D at a prompt is [`ErrorKind::Cancelled`] — exit 130, which is what a shell
//! expects from an interrupted interactive program — and not a generic error. A script wrapping
//! `fcli` has to be able to tell "the user said no" from "the command broke", so the
//! classification lives in exactly one function here.
