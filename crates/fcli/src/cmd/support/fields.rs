//! The one adapter from the generated field tables to [`crate::output::project`].
//!
//! `forgejo_client::meta_types::FieldSpec` and [`crate::output::project::FieldSpec`] are
//! structurally identical and deliberately distinct: `fcli::output` is written against no
//! generated code at all, so that field discovery keeps working — and keeps being testable —
//! in a build where the generated crate is absent. One conversion is the whole price of that
//! independence.
//!
//! There used to be five copies of it (six counting layer 2's). They had **diverged**, and the
//! divergence was visible to users in the bare-`--json` listing: three rendered a `Vec<String>`
//! field as `[string]`, two as `[json]`, and one flattened both arrays and maps to `json`. The
//! recursive form kept here is the one `crate::raw` uses, so layer 2 and layer 3 now describe
//! the same field the same way.
