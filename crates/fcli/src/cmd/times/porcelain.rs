//! Shared plumbing for the Forgejo-native groups (`times`, `stopwatch`, `wiki`, `mirror`,
//! `quota`, `package`, `nodeinfo`).
//!
//! It lives under `times` for a mechanical reason that has since expired: `cmd/mod.rs` was frozen
//! while several waves of work ran in parallel, so a neutral `cmd/support.rs` could not be
//! declared. [`crate::cmd::support`] now exists and owns the genuinely common half — the field
//! adapter, the prompting gate, the `--output` writer, the test scaffolding — which this module
//! delegates to. What is left is this wave's own `Fields`/`Machine`/`discovery` facade and its
//! rendering helpers; folding those into `support` would mean merging a fourth output facade
//! into the two that are there, which is a change of behaviour rather than of location.
//!
//! # What is actually shared
//!
//! Three decisions that every layer-3 command has to make identically, or the tool stops
//! feeling like one tool:
//!
//! 1. **Bare `--json` is answered before any request.** `fcli wiki list --json` prints the
//!    selectable field names and exits 0 — see `docs/output.md`, divergence 2 — and that has to
//!    work with no token, no network, and no configured host. So [`discovery`] is called from a
//!    group's synchronous `run`, *outside* `runtime::block_on`.
//! 2. **`--json`/`--jq`/`--template` suppress the human view entirely**, and are compiled once
//!    rather than per page.
//! 3. **A destructive action confirms on a terminal and demands `--yes` otherwise.** Never
//!    prompt when stdin is not a terminal: a command that blocks forever inside a CI job is
//!    worse than one that fails.
