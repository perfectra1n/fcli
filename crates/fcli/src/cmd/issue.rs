//! `fcli issue` — issues.
//!
//! Every subcommand here earns its place under `docs/porcelain-conventions.md`: the repository
//! is inferred, `@me` is resolved, labels and milestones are named rather than numbered, and
//! `create`/`edit` orchestrate several calls. What layer 2 cannot do is the point — `fcli raw
//! issue create-issue` needs a milestone *id* and label *ids*, which nobody has memorised.
//!
//! # What Forgejo's API cannot do, and so neither can this
//!
//! `gh issue` has four verbs with no Forgejo endpoint behind them at API version 16.0.4:
//! `lock`/`unlock` (`Issue.is_locked` is reported but not writable), `transfer`, and `develop`.
//! They are deliberately absent rather than present-and-failing: a subcommand that exists and
//! always errors is worse than one that was never offered, because it survives into scripts.
//! The group's `--help` says so, so the absence is discoverable without reading this file.
//!
//! # What Forgejo can do that GitHub cannot
//!
//! Issue **dependencies** and **pinning with a position**, both exposed here:
//!
//! ```text
//! fcli issue depends list 42            # what blocks #42, and what #42 blocks
//! fcli issue depends add 42 --blocked-by 7
//! fcli issue pin 42 --position 1
//! ```
//!
//! The two directions are separate endpoints and they are easy to confuse:
//! `/issues/42/dependencies` is *what blocks 42*, `/issues/42/blocks` is *what 42 blocks*.
//! `--blocked-by` and `--blocks` name the direction the way a human says it out loud.
