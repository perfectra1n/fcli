//! `fcli pr merge` — one style enum, and the server's own reason when it says no.
//!
//! # One enum, not three booleans
//!
//! `gh` has `--merge`, `--squash` and `--rebase` as three independent booleans, and then has to
//! reject two of them together. Forgejo's API takes a single `Do` field whose value is one of
//! `merge`, `rebase`, `rebase-merge`, `squash`, `fast-forward-only`, `manually-merged` — so `-s`
//! takes that value directly and cannot express a contradiction. `--merge`, `--squash` and
//! `--rebase` are kept as aliases because the muscle memory is real, and they are `conflicts_with`
//! each other so the contradiction is still a usage error rather than a coin toss.
//!
//! `fast-forward-only` has no `gh` equivalent at all. It is the option for a repository that wants a
//! linear history with no merge commit and no rewriting, and it is worth knowing exists.
//!
//! # The refusal
//!
//! **Forgejo answers an un-mergeable pull request with HTTP 405** and a body explaining why: the
//! branch is behind, a required check has not passed, a review is missing, the pull request is a
//! draft. `tea`'s single worst bug is printing `failed to merge PR, is it still open?` for every one
//! of those.
//!
//! Nothing in this module is needed to avoid it any more. `forgejo_core`'s classifier splits a 405
//! on its body: an HTML page or an empty body really is a missing route and stays
//! `RouteNotFound`, while a 405 that carries words becomes `ErrorKind::StateConflict`, which names
//! the resource (`pull request 4212`) and prints the server's own reason. So the merge goes
//! through the typed client like every other call, and the reason survives because the taxonomy
//! has somewhere to put it.
