//! `fcli stopwatch` — the live timer.
//!
//! `tea` does not expose this at all, and neither does `gh`, because GitHub has no equivalent
//! feature. It is one of the clearer arguments for a Forgejo-native CLI: the timer is already in
//! the web UI, and until now the only way to start one from a terminal was a hand-written
//! `curl`.
//!
//! # The one invariant everything here is shaped around
//!
//! **One stopwatch per user, instance-wide.** Not one per repository, not one per issue — one.
//! `GET /user/stopwatches` returns a list because that is the shape REST wanted, but it holds at
//! most one element. Every design decision below follows from that:
//!
//! * `stop`, `cancel`, and `status` take **no arguments** and need **no repository**. The server
//!   already knows which issue is being timed, so asking the user to repeat it — or to be inside
//!   the right checkout — would be pure ceremony. `fcli stopwatch stop` works from a home
//!   directory, which is where you are when you remember you left one running.
//! * `start` on a second issue cannot silently work. Forgejo would refuse, or (worse, depending
//!   on version) move the timer. So `start` reads the running stopwatch first and, if there is
//!   one, **names the issue it is on** and the two ways out. An error that says "conflict"
//!   without saying *what* conflicts is the failure mode this exists to avoid.
//!
//! # Stopping is not cancelling
//!
//! `stop` converts the elapsed time into a tracked-time entry (see [`crate::cmd::times`]).
//! `cancel` throws it away. The API spells the second one `DELETE …/stopwatch/delete`, which
//! reads like a cleanup rather than a data loss, so both commands report how much time was at
//! stake before acting on it.
