//! `fcli admin` — instance administration.
//!
//! This group has **no equivalent in `gh` at all**, and `tea` covers only `tea admin users`. It is
//! the largest single capability gap between `fcli` and both of them, so it is written for the
//! person most likely to be reading it: an operator with a broken instance and a terminal.
//!
//! Three rules follow from that reader:
//!
//! 1. **Every help string says what the command does *to the instance*,** not which endpoint it
//!    calls. "Create an account and, optionally, make it a site administrator" is useful at 03:00;
//!    "POST /admin/users" is not.
//! 2. **Nothing destructive happens without a confirmation** on a terminal, or `--yes` off one.
//!    `admin adopt delete` erases a git directory that Forgejo does not have a record of, and
//!    there is nothing to undo it with.
//! 3. **A 403 names `write:admin`.** Forgejo refuses a non-admin token on `/admin/…` with
//!    `user must be site admin`, which mentions neither a scope nor a token, so the generic
//!    classifier reports it as a plain `Forbidden`. Every command here routes its errors through
//!    [`scope::admin_scope`] so the message says the one thing that fixes it: **a Forgejo token's
//!    scopes are fixed at creation, so this needs a new token.**
//!
//! # Everything here works outside a checkout
//!
//! No command in this group touches [`Runtime::repo`], so `fcli admin user create` works from
//! `/tmp`. That is not incidental — an operator is usually not standing in a clone of the
//! repository they are fixing.
//!
//! # Where `admin` stops and `fcli quota` starts
//!
//! `fcli quota` (another group) is the **read** side: what a user's quota is, what they are using.
//! `fcli admin quota` is the **write** side: creating rules and groups, and putting users in them.
//! Both helps say so, because "why is there no `fcli quota rule create`?" is otherwise a fair
//! question.
//!
//! # Not implemented, for lack of an endpoint
//!
//! User **badges** have no route in the API description this build was generated from
//! (`spec/forgejo-v16.0.4.json` mentions `badge` nowhere), so `fcli admin badge` does not exist.
//! When a Forgejo release adds it, `fcli raw search badge` will find it before this group does.
