//! `fcli completion` — a shell completion script.
//!
//! # What is and is not covered, and why
//!
//! Layer 2 is 506 operations behind a two-phase parse: `main` never builds that tree unless the
//! first non-flag word is `raw`, because constructing thousands of `Arg`s costs five to twenty
//! milliseconds on a twenty-five millisecond startup budget. `clap_complete` generates from a
//! **fully built** `Command`, so a completion script covering every layer-2 leaf would require
//! building exactly the tree the two-phase parse exists to avoid — and the resulting bash script
//! would be well over a megabyte.
//!
//! So the generated script covers layer 1 (`fcli api`), all of layer 3, and the `raw` **group**
//! names, stopping there. `--help` says so, out loud: a completion that silently omits half the
//! tool teaches users the omitted half does not exist. `fcli raw search <words>` is the discovery
//! tool for the rest, and it is named in the help text for that reason.
