//! Exit codes, and the one place a failure turns into bytes on stderr.
//!
//! Two rules:
//!
//! 1. **The exit code comes from [`forgejo_core::ErrorKind::exit_code`]**, never from a second
//!    mapping here. The table is documented in `docs/output.md` and scripts written against
//!    `gh` depend on 0/1/2/4 agreeing with it; two mappings would drift the moment a variant
//!    was added.
//! 2. **A broken pipe is success.** `fcli pr list | head -1` closes stdout under us on
//!    purpose. Combined with restoring `SIGPIPE` in `main`, this is what makes that idiom
//!    silent instead of a panic and a non-zero status.
