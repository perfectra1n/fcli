//! Which commands the live suite actually drove, recorded *as it runs*.
//!
//! # Why a runtime journal and not a grep over the sources
//!
//! The obvious way to answer "is every operation covered?" is to scan the test files for
//! mentions, the way `.mise/scan.py` scans for `unwrap()`. That is the wrong instrument here,
//! for a reason specific to this crate: [`crate::instance_or_skip`] makes a test **`return`
//! early** when no Forgejo is reachable, printing `SKIPPED` and passing. A source scan cannot
//! tell that apart from a test that ran, so on a machine without Docker — or in a CI job where
//! the daemon died — the gate would report full coverage over a suite that executed nothing.
//! That is the exact failure `cargo xtask itest` already exists to prevent (it sets
//! `FJO_ITEST_REQUIRE` so a skip becomes an error), and a coverage gate that reintroduces it
//! would be worse than no gate.
//!
//! So [`record`] is called *inside* the test body, after the instance has been acquired. A
//! skipped test records nothing, an `#[ignore]`d test records nothing, and a test whose
//! assertions were commented out still records nothing unless the `cover!` line itself ran.
//! The number cannot be inflated by a test that did not execute.
//!
//! # Why one file per process
//!
//! `cargo test` compiles every file in `tests/` into its **own binary**, and the supported
//! runner (`cargo xtask itest`) runs them concurrently. A shared journal would interleave
//! writes from six processes. Naming each journal after its pid sidesteps that entirely, and
//! `cargo xtask coverage-check` unions them — coverage is an aggregate question, so nothing is
//! lost by splitting the record.
//!
//! # Why writing is opt-in
//!
//! Recording happens only when [`DIR_ENV`] is set, which `cargo xtask itest` does after
//! clearing the directory. A bare `cargo test -p fjo-itest` therefore leaves no journal rather
//! than leaving a *partial* one, which matters because a partial journal read by the ratchet
//! would understate coverage and demand budgets be raised — the one direction a ratchet must
//! never be pushed.
