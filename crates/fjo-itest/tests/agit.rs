//! The AGit flow: a pull request with no fork and no branch.
//!
//! `fjo pr create --agit --topic <t>` pushes to `refs/for/<base>/<topic>`, and Forgejo turns
//! that push into a pull request. Nothing about it can be faked usefully — the whole mechanism
//! is a git push interpreted by the server, so a `FakeGit` test proves only that we assembled
//! the argv we meant to. This is the feature `gh` structurally cannot match, so it is worth
//! proving against a server rather than against ourselves.

/// The defining property: a pull request exists afterwards, and no branch was created for it.
///
/// The exit status *is* asserted, and the history of why it once was not is worth keeping.
///
/// It was originally ignored because reading the new pull request back decodes
/// `merge_commit_sha`, which is null while the request is open, and the command therefore
/// reported failure after the push had already succeeded. That was a real bug and it is fixed
/// (`decode::open_pull_request_decodes` covers it and no longer needs `#[ignore]`), so the
/// justification is spent.
///
/// Leaving it spent was expensive. When this test failed in CI it asserted only that a pull
/// request existed, found none, and said `left: 0, right: 1` — with the command's exit code and
/// its entire stderr discarded, so the one artifact naming the cause was thrown away. That is
/// the same "swallowed the real reason" failure this project exists to avoid, and it cost a
/// round trip through CI to notice.
///
/// So: assert the status, and put stderr in the message. A test that can fail must be able to
/// say why.
