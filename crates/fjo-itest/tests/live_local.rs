//! The setup surface, driven against a real server: `auth`, `config`, `alias`, `browse`,
//! `completion`, `status`, `search` and `run runners`.
//!
//! # Why these need a live instance at all
//!
//! Most of this group is the part of `fjo` that touches the *local machine* — a `hosts.toml`, a
//! `config.toml`, a `~/.gitconfig` — and `crates/fjo/tests/setup.rs` already drives all of it
//! hermetically against hosts nothing listens on. What that plane structurally cannot reach is
//! the moment the two halves meet:
//!
//! * `auth login` is the only command whose whole contract is *"ask the server who this token
//!   belongs to, and file it under that name"*. Against a fake there is nobody to ask, so the
//!   discovery is stubbed and the one bug it exists to prevent — a token recorded against the
//!   account the user typed — is unreachable.
//! * `auth setup-git` writes a credential helper, and the only proof it works is `git` itself
//!   cloning a private repository with no token in the URL. That is three processes (fjo, git,
//!   Forgejo) agreeing about one file.
//! * An alias is only interesting if invoking it runs a real command; `config`'s `browser` key is
//!   only interesting if a real command reads it.
//! * `status`, `search prs` and `run runners` are plain API commands with no hermetic coverage of
//!   the shapes the server actually returns.
//!
//! # Every test owns its configuration directory
//!
//! The harness points every child at one shared scratch `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, which is right for
//! the rest of the suite — nothing there writes configuration. Everything here does, and these
//! tests run on parallel threads, so each one sets `FJO_CONFIG_DIR` to a directory of its own
//! (see [`Config`]). `FJO_CREDENTIAL_STORE=file` goes with it, for the reason
//! `crates/fjo/tests/setup.rs` gives: without it a test would probe the developer's login
//! keyring, which is both slow and rude.
//!
//! # Tokens
//!
//! No assertion in this file may put a token in a failure message. `auth status` not printing
//! one is pinned hermetically; what is pinned here is that the *live* round trip does not leak
//! one either, and a test that dumps the token while proving the command did not would be
//! absurd. Hence [`no_token_anywhere`] and the length-only comparisons below.
