//! Organizations and teams, end to end against a real Forgejo.
//!
//! This is the corner of the API where a mock is least useful, because almost nothing about it
//! is addressed the way a user thinks about it. Team routes take a **numeric id**
//! (`PUT /teams/{id}/members/{u}`), organization membership *is* team membership, and the two
//! routes that publicise a membership refuse the instance admin outright — Forgejo answers
//! `403 Cannot publicize another member`, so only the member's own token can drive them. A
//! `FakeTransport` test cannot discover any of that: it returns whatever the test author
//! believed, which is exactly the belief under examination.
//!
//! Every test here therefore reads its mutation back **out of band** through `inst.api`, and
//! every test owns a freshly created organization so the suite can run on parallel threads
//! against the one shared container.
