//! Forgejo Actions, driven against a server with **no runner attached**.
//!
//! That constraint is the whole subject of this file rather than an excuse for skipping it.
//! Without a runner nothing ever *executes*, but a great deal still happens: a dispatch is
//! accepted and queues a run, a push queues one, `cancel` and `delete` act on it, and the three
//! repository-wide lists answer with the empty-but-typed shapes the generated models decode
//! into. Those are exactly the parts a `FakeTransport` test cannot check, because a mock
//! invents the reply it is then asserted against.
//!
//! # Two instance shapes, and why every test here still has to survive both
//!
//! The harness used to boot its container with `FORGEJO__actions__ENABLED=false`, and that
//! setting is not repository-local: with it off, Forgejo puts the Actions unit in its disabled
//! set, so `PATCH /repos/{owner}/{repo}` with `has_actions: true` was accepted, returned 200, and
//! left `has_actions` **false** — measured, not assumed. Every route under
//! `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/` then answered 404 for the unit rather than for the id, and
//! four of the twelve operations here were unreachable. That is fixed at the source (cbe2134):
//! the harness now enables Actions, so every test in this file runs.
//!
//! The distinction the file was built around is still worth keeping, because the suite can also
//! be pointed at somebody else's server with `FJO_TEST_HOST`, where Actions may well be off:
//!
//! * Those that hold under **either** configuration make no check at all. A missing run id is a
//!   404 whether the unit is off or the id is absent, so "this exits 5 and says 404" is a real
//!   assertion about the request path, the response classification and the error rendering in
//!   both worlds. `workflow list`/`view` are in this group for a different reason — they are
//!   built from the contents API, not from an Actions route, so they work with the unit off.
//! * Those that need the unit call [`actions_or_skip`] **before** `cover!`, so an instance
//!   without Actions records nothing. That ordering is the same contract `instance_or_skip!`
//!   has, and for the same reason: coverage that a skipped test claimed would be a lie told by
//!   the gate that exists to stop exactly this. Against the harness that guard never fires.
//!
//! # What a runner would buy
//!
//! Only the *outcome* half, and the tests below pin where the line falls. A dispatch is accepted
//! and mints a run, the run's job is created and named — and then nothing happens: the run is
//! born `waiting` and stays there, so there is no `success`/`failure` to observe,
//! `repoGetActionJobLogs` answers 404 for a job that exists but never started, `task list` stays
//! empty because a task is created when a runner *claims* a job, and no artifact is ever
//! uploaded, which is why the three artifact operations are reachable only through their
//! not-found paths.
