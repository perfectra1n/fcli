//!
//! The renderings are snapshot-tested elsewhere against hand-written `ServerBody` values. What
//! that cannot establish is whether Forgejo actually *produces* those bodies — whether a 403
//! really names a scope, whether a 422 on topics really carries `invalidTopics`, whether the
//! extra probe on a 404 really fires. Each test here provokes the status from the real server.
//!
//! The governing rule, from the design: never swallow a server message. `tea`'s worst habit is
//! reporting "failed to merge PR, is it still open?" for every refusal while discarding the
//! reason the server gave.
