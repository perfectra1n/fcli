//! The account itself: keys, tokens, emails, follows, stars, watches, blocks and notifications.
//!
//! Almost every route here answers with something other than a JSON body, and that is exactly
//! what a `FakeTransport` cannot check because the fake decides for itself what came back. Three
//! shapes recur:
//!
//! * **204 vs 404 as a boolean.** `GET /user/following/{name}`, `/user/starred/{o}/{r}` and
//!   `/repos/{o}/{r}/subscription` answer `204 No Content` for yes and `404` for no. Nothing in
//!   the response says which question was asked, so a client that maps 404 to "the user does not
//!   exist" reports the wrong thing and a mock never notices.
//! * **Empty 204 mutations.** Follow, unfollow, block, unblock, star, unstar, every variable and
//!   secret write, and both email writes return no body. The only evidence they did anything is
//!   a second, independent read — so every mutation below is read back with `inst.api`, never
//!   trusted because the command exited 0.
//! * **Routes that refuse a token on purpose.** `/users/{name}/tokens` is `reqBasicAuth()`, so a
//!   token is answered 401 by design and `fjo` has to fall back to a password. That fallback
//!   reads stdin when there is no terminal, which the shared harness cannot drive — hence
//!   [`fjo_stdin`] below.
//!
//! One test here does not use the shared instance. `/user/activitypub/follow` is gated behind
//! `[federation] ENABLED`, which the shared instance must not set — with federation on, Forgejo
//! 16.0.4 answers `PUT /user/starred/{owner}/{repo}` with a 500, which would silently break
//! starring for every suite in the repository. So that one test asks `fjo_itest::federated()`
//! for a second container, and records nothing when there is not one.
