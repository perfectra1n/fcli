//! Standard base64, because the API carries data in it.
//!
//! # Why this is here rather than a dependency
//!
//! The alphabet is fixed by RFC 4648 §4 and cannot drift, the whole implementation is under a
//! hundred lines, and `forgejo-core` already needed an encoder for HTTP Basic. A crate — plus a
//! `deny.toml` entry, plus a supply-chain surface — for that is a poor trade in a published
//! runtime whose selling point is a small dependency tree.
//!
//! # Why it is public
//!
//! Base64 is not an implementation detail of this crate; it is part of the **API's data model**.
//! `WikiPage.content_base64`, `CreateFileOptions.content`, `ChangeFileOperation.content` and
//! both avatar endpoints all carry base64 in a JSON body, so every consumer of the generated
//! client needs a codec to use them at all. Keeping it private forced `fjo` to hand-roll a
//! second copy under `cmd/wiki/b64.rs`, with a module comment saying so.
//!
//! Both RFC 4648 alphabets are implemented, and the reason is worth recording because this
//! comment used to say the opposite. The standard alphabet (§4) is what the *spec* carries, and
//! that remained true. The URL-safe alphabet (§5) is required by PKCE — RFC 7636 §4.2 fixes the
//! `code_challenge` as unpadded base64url of a SHA-256 digest — and PKCE lives on Forgejo's
//! OAuth2 endpoints, which are under the web root and so never appear in the spec at all. The
//! old reasoning was sound about the thing it was looking at; the OAuth flow is outside it.
