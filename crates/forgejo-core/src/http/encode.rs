//! Percent-encoding for path parameters and query values.
//!
//! Encoding is **per-parameter**, not per-path, and that distinction is the whole reason this
//! module exists. Most Forgejo path parameters are single segments (`{owner}`, `{repo}`,
//! `{index}`) where a `/` in the value must become `%2F` or it silently changes which route
//! matches. But a handful of parameters (`filepath`, `treePath`, `ref`, `path`, `filename`)
//! carry a *whole path*, and encoding their `/` turns `GET .../contents/src/main.rs` into a
//! request for a file literally named `src/main.rs` in the root — which 404s for every
//! nested file in every repository.
//!
//! Both directions of the mistake are real, so both are unit-tested below: `src/main.rs` must
//! survive [`path_like`] intact, and an owner literally named `a/b` must come out of [`seg`]
//! as `a%2Fb`.
//!
//! We hand-roll the encoder rather than take a `percent-encoding` dependency: the rule is
//! twelve lines, and the set of characters we preserve is a decision worth having in front of
//! us rather than behind a crate feature flag.
