//! Pagination: the highest-consequence module in this crate.
//!
//! # Why this is hand-written
//!
//! The Forgejo Swagger document declares **no `Link` header anywhere** — the mechanism the live
//! API actually paginates with. (`X-Total-Count` fares slightly better: 32 of the 174 shared
//! `#/responses` entries declare it, and no inline operation response does.) So pagination cannot
//! be generated from the spec; it has to be discovered at runtime and treated as optional, because
//! an older instance, a stripping reverse proxy, or an endpoint that simply never emitted them
//! will send neither.
//!
//! # Why the obvious termination rule is wrong
//!
//! The intuitive rule is "if a page came back shorter than the `limit` I asked for, it was the
//! last page." It is wrong, and it fails **silently, with data loss, and with a successful exit
//! code**.
//!
//! Forgejo clamps `limit` to `max_response_items` (default **50**) without saying so: no
//! warning, no header, no error. Ask for 100, get 50. Under the intuitive rule the client sees
//! `50 < 100`, concludes it has everything, and stops. `fcli issue list --limit 100` on a
//! repository with 300 issues prints 50 issues and exits 0. No one notices until a script that
//! was supposed to close stale issues quietly stops after the first fifty.
//!
//! The fix is rule (c) below: compare against the **observed first-page size**, never the
//! requested limit. If page 1 came back with 50 items, then 50 is this endpoint's page size,
//! and only a page with fewer than 50 can be the last one.
//!
//! # The algorithm
//!
//! ```text
//! effective_limit = min(requested, caps.max_response_items)  if /settings/api succeeded
//!                 | unset (let the server choose)            otherwise
//! terminate when ANY of:
//!   a. a Link header WAS present but has no rel="next"                (authoritative)
//!   b. returned == 0                                                  (always safe)
//!   c. no Link header at all AND returned < OBSERVED first-page size
//!   d. total_count known AND cumulative >= total_count
//!   e. cumulative >= the user's --limit N
//! follow Link rel="next" verbatim when present; else increment `page`
//! ```
//!
//! # Why there is a sixth rule, and why it is an error
//!
//! Rules (a)-(e) all require the **server** to cooperate: to send a `Link`, to send an
//! `X-Total-Count`, to run out of items, or to honour `?page`. An instance that ignores `?page`
//! and re-serves page 1 forever, behind a proxy that strips both headers, satisfies none of
//! them: every page is a full page, no header ever says "last", and the walk falls through to
//! `Next::Page(n + 1)` for ever — 100% CPU, unbounded memory, no output, no error. That is not
//! hypothetical; it is what a `?page`-ignoring instance does, and it is what [`FakeTransport`]
//! does when a canned reply ignores the page parameter.
//!
//! So there is a rule (f), [`MAX_PAGES`], that terminates **of our own accord**.
//!
//! It **errors**; it does not truncate. Quietly returning the first `MAX_PAGES` pages would be
//! the silent-data-loss failure that rules (a)-(e) exist to prevent, dressed up as a safety
//! feature: a successful exit code over an answer we know to be incomplete. The one thing worse
//! than hanging is printing a wrong answer and exiting 0.
//!
