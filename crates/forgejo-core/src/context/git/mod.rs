//! Reading *and writing* the local git repository, by **shelling out to `git`**.
//!
//! ## Why not `git2`/libgit2
//!
//! libgit2 does not honour `url.<base>.insteadOf` / `pushInsteadOf` rewrites, and does not
//! process `includeIf` in gitconfig. Both are common in corporate setups — an `insteadOf`
//! rule that rewrites `https://forge.internal/` to `ssh://git@forge.internal:2222/`, or an
//! `includeIf "gitdir:~/work/"` block that sets a different identity per directory tree.
//!
//! With libgit2 we would read the *unrewritten* URL, disagree with what the user's real
//! `git` uses for the very same remote, and then report "not a configured host" for a
//! repository they can clone and push to. That bug is nearly impossible to diagnose from the
//! error message. Shelling out inherits the user's actual configuration for free, matches
//! what `gh` does, and drops a C dependency from the build.
//!
//! On the write side the argument is stronger still. A clone URL the API handed us is
//! rewritten exactly as the user's own `git clone` would rewrite it — on a corporate forge the
//! API's `https://` URL is frequently unusable and the `insteadOf` rule is the only thing that
//! makes it work at all. Credential helpers, SSH agents and `includeIf` identities all apply,
//! which means **this crate never sees or handles a git credential**: the strongest possible
//! statement about not leaking one.
//!
//! The cost — a process spawn per operation — is real but small. `GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS=0` is set
//! on every invocation so that a read of a repository does not take `index.lock` and race with
//! an editor's background `git status`. Nothing is ever run through a shell: arguments are
//! passed as an argv, so a branch called `; rm -rf /` is a branch name and not a command.
//!
//! ## Shape
//!
//! [`GitCtx`] has two kinds of method. A handful are **required**: the reads repository
//! resolution needs, the two config writes, and [`GitCtx::exec`], which runs an argv. Everything
//! else — clone, fetch, push, checkout, branch creation, the AGit push — is a **provided**
//! method written once in terms of `exec`. So there is exactly one implementation of "what
//! argv does an AGit push produce", the real [`GitCli`] and the test [`FakeGit`] cannot drift
//! apart in it, and a test can assert on the argv a fake recorded rather than on a real
//! repository's state.
//!
//! Errors carry **git's own stderr**, never a generic replacement. `git push` refusals
//! ("Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind") and Forgejo's
//! AGit refusals both arrive there, and a wrapper that replaced them with "push failed" would
//! be the bug this project criticises `tea` for. Every message is run through `scrub` first,
//! because a remote URL can carry an embedded credential and an error is exactly the text that
//! gets pasted into a public bug report.
