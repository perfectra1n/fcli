//! AGit: a pull request with no branch and no fork.
//!
//! Every forge in the GitHub lineage needs a *branch* to open a pull request from, and — if
//! you cannot write to the repository — a *fork* to put that branch in. Forgejo also accepts
//! pull requests over **AGit**, which needs neither. You push to a magic ref:
//!
//! ```text
//! git push origin HEAD:refs/for/main/my-topic
//! ```
//!
//! and the server creates a pull request against `main` from those commits. Nothing is added
//! to the repository's branch namespace, no fork exists, and a contributor with no write
//! access can do it against a repository that allows it. **`git push` is the entire
//! protocol**, which is why this is structural rather than a feature `gh` merely lacks: there
//! is no GitHub API call that would do it, and no amount of REST on our side substitutes for
//! the push. It is also why it lives here, next to the other git writes, rather than in a
//! client module.
//!
//! Three rules the implementation has to respect, because Forgejo enforces them:
//!
//! 1. **A topic is mandatory.** `refs/for/<base>` with no topic is refused, so
//!    [`AgitRef::new`] refuses it first, with a message that says why.
//! 2. **Updating means pushing the same topic again.** A different topic opens a *second*
//!    pull request, which is why a caller's default topic has to be something stable — a
//!    branch name, not a timestamp.
//! 3. **An amended or rebased history needs a force push** (`fjo pr create --agit
//!    --force-push`), since the update must otherwise be a fast-forward. That is the same rule
//!    as any other push, arriving in a place people do not expect it, so
//!    [`AgitRemedy::ForcePush`](crate::error::AgitRemedy::ForcePush) names it when git's own
//!    words match.
//!
//! A refused push therefore produces [`ErrorKind::AgitRefused`], carrying the refspec, the
//! remedy [`AgitRemedy::from_stderr`](crate::error::AgitRemedy::from_stderr) classified, and
//! git's own words. This module deliberately owns **no** advice text of its own: a second
//! renderer building `"{advice}\n\ngit said:\n{said}"` next to the three-part shape
//! `error::render` owns is how the two silently stop agreeing.
//!
//! Reference: <https://forgejo.org/docs/latest/user/agit-support/>.
