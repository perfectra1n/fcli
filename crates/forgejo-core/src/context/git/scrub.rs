//! Making git's own words safe to print.
//!
//! Every message this module produces quotes something git was given or said, and both can
//! carry a credential. A remote URL is the obvious one — `https://user:token@forge/o/r.git`
//! is a perfectly ordinary thing to find in `remote.origin.url`, and it appears verbatim in
//! git's argv *and* in git's error output ("fatal: could not read from
//! 'https://user:token@forge/o/r.git'"). An error that relays that untouched publishes the
//! token the moment someone pastes it into a bug report.
//!
//! The redaction itself is [`crate::http::redact`]'s, unchanged: one implementation, so a
//! fix there fixes both paths. What this module adds is finding the URLs inside free-form
//! text, since `redact::url` expects to be handed one URL rather than four lines of prose
//! with three URLs in them.
