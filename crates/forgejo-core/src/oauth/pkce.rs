//! PKCE, and the random values the flow depends on being unguessable.
//!
//! PKCE (RFC 7636) exists because a public client cannot keep a secret. Without it, anyone who
//! intercepts the authorization code — another process watching the loopback port, a browser
//! extension, a logged URL — can redeem it, since redeeming needs only the code and a client id
//! that is published in the binary. PKCE closes that by having the client invent a random
//! `code_verifier`, send only its SHA-256 digest up front, and reveal the verifier when it
//! redeems the code. An intercepted code is then useless without a value that never travelled
//! over the same channel.
