//! Finding the authorize and token endpoints.
//!
//! Forgejo publishes an OpenID Connect discovery document and has kept the same two paths for
//! years, so this could reasonably be a pair of constants. It is not, for one reason: a constant
//! is a guess that cannot be corrected, and an instance behind a reverse proxy that relocates
//! them would be unreachable with no way for the user to say otherwise. Discovery asks; the
//! constants are what we fall back to when nothing answers.
