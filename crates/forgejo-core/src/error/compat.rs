//! Forward-compatibility notes, collected during a run and reported once at exit.
//!
//! This is the observable half of the tolerant-parsing strategy. Open enums accept unknown
//! values and unparseable timestamps become `None`, both silently as far as the request is
//! concerned — that is deliberate, because a newer server must never break the CLI. But
//! silence would also hide a real signal, so every such event is recorded here and `main`
//! drains the set into a single grouped note on stderr.
//!
//! The note never changes the exit code. Suppress it with `FCLI_NO_COMPAT_NOTES=1`.
