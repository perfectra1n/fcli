//! HTTP status + body → [`ErrorKind`].
//!
//! # Never swallow a server message
//!
//! Forgejo's error bodies come in at least four shapes, and which one you get depends on the
//! handler rather than on the status code:
//!
//! ```text
//! {"message": "…", "url": "…"}                   the APIError shape, most common
//! {"errors": ["…", "…"]}                          bulk validation
//! {"title": ["can't be blank"], "body": [ … ]}    a field map
//! <html>…</html>                                  the route does not exist at all
//! ```
//!
//! [`parse_body`] tries all of them, and when none matches it keeps the raw bytes so the
//! renderer can print them verbatim under `server says:`. That fallback is not a nicety. `tea`'s
//! single worst UX bug is printing `failed to merge PR, is it still open?` for *every* merge
//! refusal while discarding the server's actual reason — which might have been "the base branch
//! has protected-branch checks pending" or "you are not a reviewer". A message we do not
//! understand is still the only person in the conversation who knows what went wrong.
//!
//! The shapes **mix**, which is the part that is easy to get wrong. `PUT /repos/{o}/{r}/topics`
//! answers a bad topic name with
//!
//! ```text
//! {"invalidTopics": ["Bad Topic"], "message": "Topic names are invalid"}
//! ```
//!
//! — an envelope *and* a field map in one object. Recognising `message` and stopping there
//! leaves the user with "the server rejected the values in this request" and no idea which
//! value, which is the same bug as `tea`'s wearing a better hat. So the field-map pass runs in
//! two modes: on its own when the body has no envelope keys at all, and **alongside** an
//! envelope, harvesting only the keys the envelope does not claim. `invalidTopics` survives
//! either way.
//!
//! # 405 is a refusal at least as often as it is a missing route
//!
//! `405 Method Not Allowed` reads like "this instance has a different API shape", and sometimes
//! it is. But Forgejo also answers a *refused operation* with it: `PUT /pulls/{n}/merge` on a
//! closed, draft, behind-its-base, or check-blocked pull request is a 405 whose body says
//! exactly which. Mapping every 405 to [`ErrorKind::RouteNotFound`] throws that body away by
//! construction — the variant has nowhere to put it. So a 405 that carries a readable message
//! becomes [`ErrorKind::StateConflict`], which prints it; only an HTML or empty-bodied 405 is
//! read as a missing route, the same test `classify_404` already applies.
//!
//! # The 404 problem
//!
//! A `404` from this API is genuinely ambiguous, and the three explanations have nothing in
//! common: the inner resource is missing, the repository is missing (or private, or on another
//! host), or the *endpoint* does not exist on this instance. Guessing wrong sends the user to
//! debug the wrong thing. So classification takes a [`RepoProbe`] result: the client fires one
//! cheap `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}` before classifying, which collapses the first two cases
//! into a definite answer, and an HTML body or an unrecognised route root identifies the third.
//!
//! There is a **fourth** case, and it looks like the first until you notice the path. A 404 on a
//! *collection* — `POST /repos/{o}/{r}/pulls` — names no object, so no object in it can be the
//! one that is missing: what 404'd is something the request *referred to*, which for a
//! `pr create` is the head branch. `resource_of` returns an empty identifier there, and reading
//! that as an object is what produced "that pull request does not exist … the identifier is what
//! is wrong" for a user who was creating one, alongside an invitation to go and list the pull
//! requests. The identifier stays empty and the renderer reports the collection.
//!
//! Which is also where the rule at the top of this module bit hardest for longest. Forgejo
//! answers exactly that request with
//!
//! ```text
//! ["could not find 'no-such-branch' to be a commit, branch or tag…"]
//! ```
//!
//! — a bare array, the third body shape, and the only thing in the whole response that knows what
//! went wrong. It was discarded **by construction**: neither [`ErrorKind::ResourceNotFound`] nor
//! [`ErrorKind::RepoNotFound`] had a field to put it in. Both do now, filled by
//! `not_found_message`, which drops a body only when it restates the status code — so
//! `server says: Not Found` never takes up a line and `could not find 'no-such-branch'…` always
//! does.
