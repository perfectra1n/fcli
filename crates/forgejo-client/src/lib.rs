//! Complete Forgejo API client, generated from the OpenAPI specification.
//!
//! # Getting started
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # async fn f() -> forgejo_client::Result<()> {
//! use forgejo_client::{Api, forgejo_core::http::Auth};
//!
//! let api = Api::new(forgejo_core::http::Client::new("https://codeberg.org", Auth::token("…"))?);
//! let pr = api.repo().get_pull_request("forgejo", "forgejo", 1).await?;
//! println!("{}", pr.title);
//! # Ok(()) }
//! ```
//!
//! [`Api`] is a thin borrow-and-dispatch wrapper: `api.repo()` hands back a zero-cost
//! [`ops::Repo`] holding a `&Client`, and every operation in the group hangs off it. One
//! accessor per API group, generated so that a group added upstream cannot be unreachable.
//!
//! # What the generated surface promises
//!
//! **Every generated method is concrete.** No type parameters, no `impl Trait` arguments, no
//! macros with logic. A body is `&forgejo_model::CreateIssueOption`; a paginated collection is
//! `ItemStream<T>`; a download is `(Mime, ByteStream)`. All polymorphism lives in hand-written
//! [`forgejo_core::http`]. With 506 operations, one generic parameter would monomorphise per
//! operation *and* per call site and make this crate's compile time superlinear in how much code
//! uses it.
#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
// Spec descriptions are prose written for the Swagger UI, not rustdoc. `ir/doc.rs` escapes `[`
// and `]` before emission, but a bare URL in a sentence is not something a generator can rewrite
// without mangling the sentence, and neither is worth failing a published crate's docs build
// over. The fix, if one is ever wanted, belongs in `ir/doc.rs` rather than here.
