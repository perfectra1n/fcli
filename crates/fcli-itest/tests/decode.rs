//! Decoding what Forgejo actually sends.
//!
//! Go marshals a nil pointer and a nil slice as `null`. The specification says only
//! `"type": "string"`, so the generator emits `String` with `#[serde(default)]` — and
//! `#[serde(default)]` covers an **absent** key, not an explicit `null`. Every fixture built
//! from the specification therefore agrees with us, and only a real server disagrees.
//!
//! `FakeTransport` cannot find any of this, because the canned responses are written by the
//! same reading of the specification that produced the types.
