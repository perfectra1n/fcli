//! `cargo xtask coverage-check` — the ratchet over which commands the test suites actually drove.
//!
//! # What it measures
//!
//! Two planes, because they answer different questions and deserve different gates:
//!
//! * **contract** — every one of the 506 generated operations had its composed request checked
//!   against its own metadata, hermetically (`crates/fjo/tests/raw_contract.rs`). That test is a
//!   loop over `OPS`, so its coverage is complete *by construction* and any gap is a bug in the
//!   test rather than missing work. This plane is therefore a **hard failure at one**, not a
//!   budget.
//! * **live** — the operation was driven against a real Forgejo (`crates/fjo-itest`). This one
//!   is genuine, drainable debt, so it gets a count budget in the style of
//!   [`docs/ratchets.md`](../../docs/ratchets.md): over budget fails, under budget nags.
//!
//! # Why it reads journals instead of scanning sources
//!
//! `crates/fjo-itest/src/coverage.rs` explains the reasoning in full. The short version: the
//! live suite *skips* when Docker is unreachable, and a skip prints `ok`. A source scan cannot
//! tell a skipped test from an executed one, so it would report full coverage over a suite that
//! ran nothing — which is the exact failure `cargo xtask itest` already exists to prevent.
//!
//! # Why the budgets are arguments rather than constants
//!
//! They live in `.mise/config.toml` beside every other `BUDGET=` in this repository, so there is
//! one place a reader looks for "what are the current gates and what are their numbers". A
//! budget compiled into this binary would be the only one that is invisible there.
