//! `cargo xtask itest` — run the integration suite against a real Forgejo.
//!
//! The container lifecycle deliberately lives in `crates/fjo-itest`, not here: the tests
//! themselves need to boot, reap and inspect instances, and duplicating that in the generator
//! crate would mean two implementations drifting apart. This subcommand's whole job is to run
//! `cargo test` with the right environment, and to make a skip impossible.
//!
//! That last part is the reason this exists rather than being a line in the README. The suite
//! *skips* when no Forgejo is reachable, so that `cargo test --workspace` works on a laptop
//! without Docker — and a skip prints "ok". A CI job that silently tested nothing is worse than
//! one that failed, so `xtask itest` sets `FJO_ITEST_REQUIRE=1` and turns a skip into an error.
