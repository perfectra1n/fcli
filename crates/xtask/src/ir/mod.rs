//! The IR — **the contract between lowering and the emitters.**
//!
//! Every decision is made in [`lower`]: name mangling, `$ref` resolution, `Presence`, doc
//! cleanup, path tokenization, cycle detection. The emitters are dumb by rule:
//!
//! - **No emitter may read `overrides.toml`.** Two emitters consulting the override table could
//!   disagree about the same name.
//! - **No emitter may do string casing.** Names come from [`names`] or not at all.
//! - **No emitter may resolve a `$ref`.** By the time a [`RustType`] exists, the reference is
//!   already a decision.
//!
//! The payoff is *structural* consistency rather than reviewed consistency: a layer-2 flag name
//! and the corresponding client function's parameter name are both read off the same [`Param`]
//! value, so they cannot drift. That property is what makes 42k lines of generated code
//! reviewable by reading the IR instead.
