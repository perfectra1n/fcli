//! Renewing an OAuth session before a command uses it.
//!
//! # Why this runs on its own thread
//!
//! [`Runtime::new`](crate::runtime::Runtime::new) is called from **both** sides of
//! [`block_on`](crate::runtime::block_on): from inside an async body in most commands, and
//! synchronously from `raw.rs`'s `best_effort_slug` and `nodeinfo.rs`'s `connect`. Building a
//! tokio runtime inside another one panics, so a refresh cannot simply `block_on`, and making
//! `Runtime::new` async would put `.await` in about forty files and still leave those two
//! synchronous callers to restructure.
//!
//! A fresh thread carries no tokio thread-local, so it is correct from either side. This is the
//! same shape, and the same reasoning, as `forgejo_core::config::secrets`'s keyring timeout.
//!
//! # Why the new refresh token is written before the new access token is used
//!
//! Forgejo mints a new refresh token on every refresh. If the write fails and we use the access
//! token anyway, the session works for an hour and is then unrecoverable: the refresh token that
//! would have renewed it was never recorded, and on an instance with
//! `INVALIDATE_REFRESH_TOKENS` the old one is already dead. So a failed write means the refresh
//! did not happen, and the old credential is used for whatever life it has left.
