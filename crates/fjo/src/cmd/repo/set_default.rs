//! `fjo repo set-default` — write down which remote is *the* repository.
//!
//! Repository resolution scores remote names (`upstream` 3, `forgejo`/`codeberg` 2, `origin` 1) and
//! a tie at the top is [`ErrorKind::AmbiguousRemote`], which names the candidates and stops. This
//! command is the answer to that error, and to its opposite: a checkout where the *highest*-scoring
//! remote is not the one you mean.
//!
//! What it writes is git config `remote.<name>.fjo-resolved`, namespaced per remote exactly as
//! `gh` namespaces `gh-resolved`, so both tools live in one clone without fighting. Three values:
//!
//! | value | meaning |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | `base` | this remote's URL *is* the repository |
//! | `owner/name` or `host/owner/name` | the repository, named directly — no URL parsing at all |
//! | `NONE` | stop asking: this checkout has no Forgejo repository |
//!
//! The middle form is the escape hatch that matters. A remote written through an SSH alias
//! (`git@work-forge:whatever/thing.git`) cannot be parsed into a host and a slug by anything, and
//! `set-default` is how such a checkout is made to work at all — which is why the resolver reads
//! that value *verbatim* rather than looking at the URL again.
