//! `fjo repo archive`, `unarchive`, and `delete` — the three that need a confirmation.
//!
//! All three are one API call, so what earns them a place in layer 3 is context inference plus the
//! confirmation: `fjo raw repo delete o r` deletes a repository with no questions asked, and a
//! porcelain command that did the same would be a footgun with a friendlier name.
//!
//! Destructive on a terminal means *ask*; destructive without one means **require `--yes`**. Never
//! "proceed because nobody was watching".
