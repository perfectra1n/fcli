//! Test scaffolding shared by every group's unit tests.
//!
//! `http::Method` is deliberately never named here. `fjo` does not depend on the `http` crate,
//! and taking a dependency purely so tests can spell one type would put a public crate in
//! `Cargo.toml` for the benefit of `#[cfg(test)]` code. [`on`] therefore takes the method as a
//! string and routes it through the same `Request` constructors the client uses, which is also
//! the shape a reader of the test wants: `on(fake, "POST", path, reply)`.
//!
//! A `#[cfg(test)]` module rather than a `tests/` file, because everything worth testing is
//! crate-private: the renderers take `&Term` and the fetchers take `&Api`, and an integration
//! test could only reach them by widening their visibility for no other reason.
