//! The plumbing every layer-3 group shares: field tables, the `--json`/`--jq`/`--template`
//! triad, pagination caps, prompting, and the stderr note.
//!
//! # Why this module exists
//!
//! It did not, for a while, and the reason is worth recording because it shaped six other
//! files. `cmd/mod.rs` was frozen while several groups were built out in parallel: a module can
//! only be declared from a file that already exists, so no wave could add a neutral
//! `cmd/support.rs` without colliding with the others. Each wave grew a private copy instead —
//! `cmd/admin/support.rs`, `cmd/run/emit.rs`, `cmd/repo/shared.rs`, `cmd/auth/common.rs`,
//! `cmd/issue/shared.rs` and `cmd/times/porcelain.rs` — and one of them was then reached
//! *across* into, so eleven command groups imported `crate::cmd::admin::support` for
//! general-purpose output plumbing: a dependency graph claiming repository topics depend on
//! instance administration.
//!
//! The copies had already begun to disagree. Six adapters from the generated field tables
//! described the same `Vec<String>` field three different ways; two `split_editor_text`s each
//! mishandled a different half of what a Windows editor writes; two `label_ids` disagreed about
//! whether an organization's labels count.
//!
//! Everything genuinely common now lives here. What stayed behind stayed deliberately: a
//! helper that needs a `PullRequest`, an `Issue` or a `Label` is domain code, and moving it here
//! would relocate the coupling rather than remove it.
//!
//! # The rules it encodes
//!
//! 1. **`--json` field discovery answers before any HTTP request.** Bare `--json` prints the
//!    field list to stdout and exits 0 (`docs/output.md`, divergence 2), and it must work with
//!    no token, no network, and no configured host. Every entry point that resolves `--json`
//!    ([`emit::Json::resolve`], [`listing::discover`], [`machine::Triad`]'s callers) is called
//!    *before* the runtime is built.
//! 2. **A command never decides its own presentation.** The machine-versus-human fork lives in
//!    one of the facades here, so a group cannot accidentally print a table into a pipe or a
//!    banner into `head -1`.
//! 3. **Progress and advice go to stderr, and only for a terminal.** [`note`].
//! 4. **Prompting needs stdin *and* stdout to be real terminals**, per
//!    `docs/porcelain-conventions.md`. [`interact`].
//!
//! # Two facades, not one
//!
//! [`emit::Emit`] borrows a writer; [`listing::list`] opens `--output`'s destination itself.
//! They are not merged because the difference is real — `Emit` is what makes a command testable
//! without a `Runtime`, and `listing` is what lets a command render into a file. Both sit on the
//! same [`machine::Triad`] and the same [`fields`] adapter, which is where the duplication that
//! mattered actually was.
