//! `fjo pr diff` — the diff, with escape sequences defanged.
//!
//! # Why the sanitising is on by default
//!
//! A diff is *attacker-controlled text*. Anyone who can open a pull request chooses its contents,
//! and a terminal interprets what is written to it: an ESC sequence in a hunk can change the
//! window title, switch the character set, hide subsequent output, redefine what the cursor is
//! doing, or in some terminals stuff characters into the input queue. `gh` neutralises them for
//! this reason and it is a security convention rather than a formatting preference, so `fjo`
//! matches it: control characters are rendered as caret notation (`^[`), and only
//! `--allow-escape-sequences` turns that off.
//!
//! Tabs, newlines and carriage returns are left alone — a diff of a file containing tabs must still
//! be a diff of a file containing tabs, and those three cannot reprogram a terminal.
//!
//! Note that `--color` is the **global** flag: it already means "when to colourise", it is
//! propagated into every command, and declaring a second `--color` here would be a duplicate long
//! name, which clap answers with a panic. So `fjo pr diff --color never` works, and there is no
//! per-command flag to keep in step with it.
