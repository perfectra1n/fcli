//! `fjo admin email` — find an account by its email address.
//!
//! One verb, because there is one useful question: somebody wrote in from
//! `alice@example.invalid` and you need to know which account that is. `GET /admin/emails/search`
//! answers it, and it is the only route on the instance that maps an address back to a login —
//! `/admin/users` cannot be searched by email at all.
//!
//! With no query it falls back to `GET /admin/emails`, which lists every address on the instance.
//! That is the same command with the argument left off rather than a second verb, because "list
//! them all" and "find one" differ only in whether you know what you are looking for.
