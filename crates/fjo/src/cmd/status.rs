//! `fjo status` — the cross-repository dashboard `tea` conspicuously lacks.
//!
//! Every other list command in `fjo` is scoped to one repository, which means the question people
//! actually start their day with — *what is waiting for me anywhere?* — needs one command per
//! repository and a lot of scrolling. `/repos/issues/search` answers it in a single call because it
//! searches every repository the token can see, and the notification endpoint supplies what
//! happened since you last looked.
//!
//! This earns its place as a porcelain command on two counts from
//! `docs/porcelain-conventions.md`: it is four API calls behind one word, and its rendering — four
//! labelled sections of aligned rows — is materially better than four JSON arrays.
//!
//! # Why the responses stay as `serde_json::Value`
//!
//! Not laziness, and not a preference for untyped code. Forgejo 16.0.4 sends
//! `"assignees": null` for an unassigned issue, while the generated
//! `forgejo_model::Issue::assignees` is a `Vec<User>` carrying only `#[serde(default)]` — and
//! `serde`'s `default` fills in a *missing* field, not an explicit `null`. So
//! `Issue::search_issues_page` fails to decode against a real instance the moment any result is
//! unassigned:
//!
//! ```text
//! error: the response did not look the way this build expects
//!   at:       /0/assignees
//!   expected: invalid type: null, expected a sequence
//! ```
//!
//! Found by running this command against Forgejo 16.0.4. The proper fix belongs in the model
//! emitter — a nullable array needs `deserialize_with` mapping `null` to empty — and it is *not*
//! local to this command: it breaks every typed decode of an `Issue`. Until it lands, this command
//! walks the JSON itself, which also means `--json` hands back the API's own objects untouched,
//! exactly as `docs/output.md` promises.
