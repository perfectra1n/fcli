//! Base64, because wiki page content arrives that way.
//!
//! # Why this is hand-rolled
//!
//! `fjo` has no base64 dependency, and `forgejo-core` keeps its own fourteen-line encoder
//! private for HTTP Basic. Adding a crate to the tree — and to `deny.toml` — for the forty lines
//! below is a worse trade than writing them: the alphabet is fixed by RFC 4648 and cannot drift,
//! and the round-trip test below is the whole specification.
//!
//! # Why decoding is lenient
//!
//! [`decode`] returns the input unchanged when it is not valid base64, and that is deliberate.
//! The specification marks `WikiPage.content_base64` as encoded, but says **nothing** about
//! `sidebar` and `footer`, which Forgejo also encodes — the field names carry no hint. A
//! future or patched instance that sends one of them as plain text must not make
//! `fjo wiki view` fail; showing the text is strictly better than showing an error, and a page
//! whose body genuinely looks like base64 is decoded either way.
