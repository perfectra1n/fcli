//! `fjo auth git-credential` — git's credential-helper protocol.
//!
//! `git` runs this; a human never does. The protocol is documented in `gitcredentials(7)`: a
//! verb as `argv[1]`, then `key=value` lines on stdin terminated by a blank line or EOF, and for
//! `get` a `key=value` reply on stdout.
//!
//! # Every failure is silent success
//!
//! Nothing here returns an error. That is not laziness — it is the protocol:
//!
//! * On `get`, a helper that cannot answer is expected to say **nothing** and exit 0, so git moves
//!   on to the next helper or prompts. Exiting non-zero makes `git push` fail outright, so a host
//!   `fjo` happens not to know about would break pushes that used to work.
//! * `store` is ignored, because git would otherwise hand us a password a *user* typed and we
//!   would silently overwrite the token `auth login` verified.
//! * `erase` is ignored, and this one matters most: git erases credentials after a 401. Honouring
//!   it would mean one expired-token push silently logged the user out of `fjo` itself, and the
//!   next `fjo pr list` would report "you are not logged in" with no connection to the push.
