//! `fjo package` — the package registry.
//!
//! `gh` has no package commands and neither does `tea`, so there is no precedent to copy. Two
//! properties of Forgejo's registry shape everything below, and both are things users get wrong.
//!
//! # A package belongs to an owner, not to a repository
//!
//! The route is `/packages/{owner}/{type}/{name}/{version}`. There is no repository in it. A
//! package may be *linked* to one — `Package.repository` — and the web UI shows it on that
//! repository's page, which is where the misconception comes from, but the link is metadata. Two
//! consequences:
//!
//! * deleting the repository does not delete its packages, and they keep counting against the
//!   owner's quota (see [`crate::cmd::quota`]);
//! * `fjo package list` has to decide *whose* packages to list. It infers the owner from the
//!   repository when there is one, because a checkout of `acme/thing` almost always means "the
//!   packages `acme` publishes" — and says which owner it used, so the inference is never silent.
//!
//! # Packages are immutable
//!
//! There is no PATCH. A published version cannot be edited — not its files, not its metadata, not
//! its description. The only way to change one is to delete it and publish again, usually under a
//! new version, because most registries also refuse to accept a version number they have already
//! seen.
//!
//! So this group deliberately has **no `edit` subcommand**. Offering one that could only ever
//! fail would be worse than not having it: the user would spend the round trip and then read a
//! server error instead of the explanation, which is in `--help` where they will look first.
//!
//! Publishing is likewise absent, and is *not* an oversight: each of the 23 registry types has its
//! own upload protocol (`cargo publish`, `npm publish`, `docker push`, …) and Forgejo's REST API
//! deliberately does not abstract over them. `fjo` has nothing better to offer than the native
//! tool, so it says so rather than wrapping one of them badly.

to a repository does not change its owner. Deleting the linked repository does not
