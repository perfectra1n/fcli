//! The porcelain leaf inventory, and the contract every leaf owes its user.
//!
//! `porcelain_cli.rs` checks the *shape* of the layer-3 tree — that clap can build it without
//! panicking and that no group steals a global's name. This file checks the *leaves*, one at a
//! time, and for the same reason: every global flag is `.global(true)`, so clap propagates it into
//! each subcommand while building, and **clap answers a duplicate long name with a `panic!`, not
//! an error**. `porcelain_cli.rs`'s module docs record the three live crashes that exposure
//! produced. `debug_assert` catches a name collision; it does not catch a global that silently
//! failed to reach a leaf, or a leaf that reached the user with no description.
//!
//! It also emits the inventory a coverage ratchet consumes. Set `FJO_COVERAGE_DIR` and every leaf
//! path lands in `$FJO_COVERAGE_DIR/porcelain-inventory.json` as a sorted JSON array. Unset — the
//! ordinary `mise run test` run — nothing is written, because a test that touches the filesystem
//! by default is a test that fails on a read-only checkout and races itself under `cargo nextest`.
