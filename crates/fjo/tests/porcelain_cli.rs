//! The layer-3 command tree, checked as clap sees it.
//!
//! `crate::raw` already has a smoke test that builds the 506-operation layer-2 tree, and its
//! comment explains why: **clap answers a duplicate flag name with a `panic!`**, so a collision is
//! a crash reachable from an ordinary command line rather than a compile error. Layer 3 had no
//! equivalent test, and it has exactly the same exposure — every global flag is
//! `.global(true)` and is therefore propagated into every subcommand, so a group that declares
//! `--template`, `--limit`, or `-q` panics the moment somebody runs it.
//!
//! That is not hypothetical. Writing this test found three live crashes in the group this file was
//! added with:
//!
//! ```text
//! fjo admin repo create   --template collides with the global --template
//! fjo admin repo list     -q         collides with the global -q (--jq)
//! fjo admin quota rule …  --limit    collides with the global --limit
//! ```
//!
//! `Command::debug_assert` runs clap's own consistency checks over the whole tree, which is the
//! same thing that would fire at runtime — only here it fires in CI instead of in a user's
//! terminal.
