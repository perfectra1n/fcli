"""Source-scanning primitives for the fcli ratchets (`mise run panic-check` etc.).

This is the fcli analogue of kopiur's `crates/xtask/src/scan.rs`, and it makes the
same trade deliberately: it reads the workspace's `.rs` files as *text* and never
parses Rust. A parser is a dependency, a build-time cost, and a new way for a gate
to fail on valid source. Text scanning can only ever be conservative, which is the
property a ratchet needs -- an over-removal makes the count too low, never too
high, so the gate can nag but cannot cry wolf.

Three scrubbing passes, matching scan.rs:

  scrub()          -- strip comments and string/char literals, so a name that
                      appears only in a doc comment or an error message is not
                      mistaken for code. (`checks.rs` mentions `std::process::exit`
                      twice in prose for every one time it calls it.)
  strip_cfg_test() -- strip `#[cfg(test)]` items by brace matching, so test
                      fixtures do not count as shipping code.
  sources()        -- the `.rs` walker, excluding `generated/` and `tests/`.

Run any check with `--list` to print the offending file:line rows instead of just
the count; that is how you drain one.

Deliberately depends on nothing but a stock python3 (already assumed by this
repo's CI). Keep it that way: a lint gate that needs its own install step is a
lint gate people delete.

# --- the zero-value-in-a-request-body check --------------------------------
#
# The bug this counts is small to write and expensive to ship. A generated
# request-body model spells a not-required field `Option<T>` with
# `skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none"`, so a field the user never set is
# OMITTED from the JSON. That is not a style choice: it is the fix for a
# data-loss defect (commit b62c3d1), where every PATCH was a full overwrite that
# blanked whatever the user had not mentioned. A call site that writes
# `Some(x.unwrap_or_default())` hands the model the exact zero value the
# `Option` existed to omit, and the overwrite comes straight back.
#
# The live symptom was `fcli repo fork` answering `500 name is empty`, because
# the call site turned "no --fork-name" into `Some("")`. No test caught it and
# no test could have: `FakeTransport` accepts any body, so only an assertion on
# the SHAPE of the request -- `sent.get("name").is_none()` -- would fail, and
# almost none exist. This is a class the suite is structurally blind to, which
# is what a ratchet is for.
#
# WHY THIS IS TYPE-SCOPED AND NOT A GREP. A bare search for
# `Some(...unwrap_or_default())` is worse than no gate: this tree has
# `GlobalOpts { json: Some(String::new()) }`, `PageInfo { total_count: ... }`,
# `ResolveOptions`, and query clamps like
# `Some(i32::try_from(limit).unwrap_or(i32::MAX))`, none of which is the bug.
# So the set of fields that can be wrong is DERIVED from the generated models
# (`request_body_fields`): a field only counts if it really carries
# `skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none"`. Query structs are not body models
# and drop out entirely; when the spec changes, the set follows codegen instead
# of rotting in a literal here.
